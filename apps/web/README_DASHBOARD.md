# Dashboard Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Created Dashboard Page** (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Full dashboard UI with sidebar navigation
   - Stats cards showing key metrics (partners, projects, revenue, leads)
   - Quick actions for common tasks
   - Recent activity feed
   - Responsive design with mobile menu

2. **Created Dashboard Layout** (`/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
   - Authentication protection for the dashboard route
   - Redirects to login if no auth token found

3. **Created Partners Page** (`/src/app/partners/page.tsx`)
   - Example of a protected route
   - Shows list of partners with search functionality
   - Cards display with partner details
   - Navigation back to dashboard

4. **Added Middleware** (`/src/middleware.ts`)
   - Basic setup for handling public vs protected routes
   - Allows auth endpoints and static files

## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in at `/login` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
2. User registers at `/register` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
3. Main page (`/`) checks auth and redirects to either `/dashboard` or `/login`
4. Dashboard layout verifies authentication before rendering

## Directory Structure Created

```
src/app/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── page.tsx      # Main dashboard page
│   └── layout.tsx    # Auth protection layout
├── partners/
│   └── page.tsx      # Partners management page
├── projects/         # Created directory (needs pages)
├── leads/           # Created directory (needs pages)
├── calendar/        # Created directory (needs pages)
└── settings/        # Created directory (needs pages)
```

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. **Create remaining pages**:
   - `/projects` - Project management
   - `/leads` - Lead generation and management
   - `/calendar` - Meeting scheduling
   - `/settings` - User and organization settings

2. **Add API error handling**:
   - Better error messages
   - Token refresh logic
   - Network error handling

3. **Implement real data**:
   - Connect to actual API endpoints for stats
   - Real-time updates for activity feed
   - Proper data fetching for all metrics

4. **Add features**:
   - User profile editing
   - Organization settings
   - Notification system
   - Search functionality across all entities

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to `/login`
3. Log in with valid credentials
4. Verify redirect to `/dashboard`
5. Check that all navigation links work
6. Test logout functionality
7. Verify auth protection by clearing localStorage and trying to access `/dashboard`
